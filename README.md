# DataAnalytics_PurePython
# Project Description

This project is a Python program that reads data from a CSV file containing information about countries around the world. The program takes two parameters as input, a CSV file path and a region name. The program then extracts the data related to the input region from the CSV file and performs several calculations to generate four different results:

1. Country with the minimum and maximum population in the input region.
2. Average and standard deviation of the population in the input region.
3. Density of population for each country in the input region.
4. Correlation between population and land area for all countries in the input region.

The program returns these four results as a list of lists, where each sub-list contains the calculated results for a specific task. The list is then printed to the console.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your machine.

## Usage

To use this program, you need to provide two inputs:

1. The path to the CSV file containing the country data.
2. The name of the region you want to extract data for.

Once you have these inputs, you can run the program by executing the following command in your terminal:

python main.py <csv_file_path> <region_name>
Example: python main.py countries.csv Africa

Thank you and any feedback is welcome.
